#1. :first-of-type

#2. last-of-type
- :가상선택자, 인접한 ``마지막`` 형제 요소. 같은 타입이어야 함!

#3. nth-of-type
- The :nth-of-type(an+b) CSS pseudo-class matches an element that has an+b-1 siblings with the same element name before it in the document tree, for a given positive or zero value for n, and has a parent element. See :nth-child for a more thorough description of the syntax of its argument. This is a more flexible and useful pseudo selector if you want to ensure you're selecting the same type of tag no matter where it is inside the parent element, or what other different tags appear before it.
